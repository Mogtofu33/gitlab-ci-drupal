## Future plan

You want to help me make this better? Good! just PR!

I would like to:

- Add a variable for artifacts expire_in value, when this is merged:  
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/merge_requests/1893

- Add Nightwatch [visual regression testing](https://github.com/Crunch-io/nightwatch-vrt)

- Add a matrix option like Travis to test against multiple Php versions and
databases when [Gitlab-Ci support it](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/23405)

- Test if all of this is working with some distributions like Lightning or
Varbase...

- Have a better and nice local tests solution (WIP).
